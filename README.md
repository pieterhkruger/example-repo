# Finance Calculators

Small Python tools that calculate either future investment value or monthly bond repayments. The `finance_calculators.py` script runs in the terminal and lets you pick between simple or compound interest, while `finance_calculators_streamlit.py` provides the same calculations in a Streamlit web UI.
